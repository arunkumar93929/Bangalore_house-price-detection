🏠💰 Bangalore House Price Prediction 📊🏙️


Welcome to the Bangalore House Price Prediction project! This project uses machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, size, and number of rooms.

Features 🚀


->User Input: Easily input the features of the house (like location, size, etc.).  
->Price Prediction: Predict the price of a house using a trained machine learning model.
->Interactive Web App: Use a simple, intuitive interface built with Flask and HTML/CSS.   
->Data Visualization: Visualize relationships between house features and prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

How it Works 🧠  
  This project uses multiple linear regression and other machine learning techniques to analyze the house prices in Bangalore. The dataset contains details like the number of bedrooms, square   footage, and the location. The model learns from this data and predicts house prices.

Usage 🖥️
🏙️ Select the Location: Choose the location of the house from the dropdown.
🏠 Enter House Size: Input the size of the house in square feet.
🛏️ Specify the Number of Bedrooms: Input the number of bedrooms.
📈 Predict the Price: Hit the "Predict" button to get the estimated price of the house.


Dataset 📊
The dataset is based on Bangalore house prices, containing features such as:  

Location 🏙️  
Size (in square feet) 📏  
Number of bedrooms 🛏️  
Number of bathrooms 🚿  
Balcony 🏞️  
And more...  


Future Improvements 🔮
